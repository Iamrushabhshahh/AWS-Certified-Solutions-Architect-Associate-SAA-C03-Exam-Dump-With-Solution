1] A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity.
Which solution meets these requirements

ans- Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket. 

General line: Collect huge amount of the files across multiple continents
Conditions: High speed Internet connectivity
Task: aggregate the data from all in a single S3 bucket
Requirements: as quick as possible, minimize operational complexity

Correct answer A: S3 Transfer Acceleration because:
- ideally works with objects for long-distance transfer (uses Edge Locations)
- can speed up content transfers to and from S3 as much as 50-500%
- use cases: mobile & web application uploads and downloads, distributed office transfers, data exchange with trusted partners. Generally for sharing of large data sets between companies, customers can set up special access to their S3 buckets with accelerated uploads to speed data exchanges and the pace of innovation.
-------------------------------------------------------

2]A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

ans-Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.
---------------------------------------------------------------

3]A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

ans-. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.

aws:PrincipalOrgID – Simplifies specifying the Principal element in a resource-based policy. This global key provides an alternative to listing all the account IDs for all AWS accounts in an organization. Instead of listing all of the accounts that are members of an organization, you can specify the organization ID in the Condition element.
proposes adding the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy. This would limit access to the S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations, as the aws PrincipalOrgID condition key can check if the request is coming from within the organization.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

4]An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.
Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.

Keywords:
- EC2 in VPC
- EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet
VPC endpoint allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public Internet.

With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway.
-------------------------------------------------

5]A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS

Option C, which involves copying the data to Amazon EFS and modifying the application to use Amazon EFS for document storage, is the most appropriate solution to ensure users can see all their documents at once in the duplicated architecture. Amazon EFS provides scalability, availability, and shared access, allowing both EC2 instances to access and synchronize the documents seamlessly. Unlike EBS volumes or snapshots, which cannot be shared in real time across multiple instances and Availability Zones, Amazon EFS allows both EC2 instances to access the same file system simultaneously, ensuring all users see the same set of documents regardless of which instance serves their request.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6]A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

  B Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3

 On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.
---------------------------------------------------------

7] A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.
Which solution meets these requirements?

D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues. 

A good practice is to also add message attributes when publishing to SNS. Each SQS subscription can have a filter policy that matches only the messages it cares about, so that only relevant messages are delivered to each SQS queue, and consumers only see/process what they need.

an SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.

It's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8] A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?

B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.

Option B: This option provides a decoupled architecture where the jobs are sent to an SQS queue. The compute nodes (EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group) can then process these jobs. Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue (the number of messages) allows the architecture to adapt to variable workloads, scaling out when the queue depth increases and scaling in when the depth decreases.
----------------------------------------------------------------

9] A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle management to avoid future storage issues.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

Option B: Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a hybrid cloud storage solution, integrating on-premises environments with cloud storage. Files written to the file share are automatically saved as S3 objects. With S3 Lifecycle policies, you can transition objects between storage classes. Transitioning to Glacier Deep Archive is suitable for rarely accessed files. This solution addresses both the storage capacity and lifecycle management requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

10] A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing

11] A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager and attach an IAM role that grants access to that secret to the EC2 instances that need it. Turn on automatic rotation. 

 AWS Secrets Manager is a secrets management service that helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources. This service enables you to rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12] A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.

CloudFront with Multiple Origins: CloudFront allows you to set up multiple origins for your distribution, so you can use both the ALB (for dynamic content) and the S3 bucket (for static content) as origins. This means that both your dynamic and static content can be served through CloudFront, which will cache content at edge locations to reduce latency.
Route 53 Integration with CloudFront: Amazon Route 53 can be easily configured to route traffic for your domain to a CloudFront distribution. Users will access your domain, and Route 53 will direct them to the nearest CloudFront edge location.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13] A company performs monthly maintenance on its AWS infrastructure. During these maintenance activities, the company needs to rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.

AWS Secrets Manager allows you to store, manage, and rotate secrets, such as database credentials, across multiple AWS Regions. By enabling multi-Region secret replication, you can replicate the secrets across the required Regions to allow for seamless rotation of the credentials during maintenance activities. Additionally, Secrets Manager provides automatic rotation of secrets on a schedule, which would minimize the operational overhead of rotating the credentials on a monthly basis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14] A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.

Option C: Using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas is the most appropriate solution. Aurora is a MySQL-compatible relational database engine that provides high performance and scalability. With Multi-AZ deployment, the database is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
Aurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on the workload, ensuring that read requests can be distributed effectively and the database can scale to meet demand. This provides both high availability and automatic scaling to handle unpredictable read workloads.

The company needs a reporting solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources within the data lake. Only the company's management team should have full access to all the visualizations. The rest of the company should have only limited access.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups

using Amazon QuickSight, which is a business intelligence tool provided by AWS for data visualization and reporting. With this option, you can connect all the data sources within the data lake, including Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. You can create datasets within QuickSight that pull data from these sources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

17] A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances

An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.
------------------------------------------------

18] An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket. 

B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue

Option A: By creating an Amazon SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded, the system establishes a durable and scalable way to handle incoming image processing tasks.

Option B: Configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source allows it to retrieve messages from the queue and process them in a stateless manner. After successfully processing the image, the Lambda function can delete the message from the queue to avoid duplicate processing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19] A company has a three-tier web application that is deployed on AWS. The web servers are deployed in a public subnet in a VPC. The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets.
A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

 Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

 Gateway Load Balancer is a new type of load balancer that operates at layer 3 of the OSI model and is built on Hyperplane, which is capable of handling several thousands of connections per second. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are configured in spoke VPCs originating or receiving traffic from the Internet. This architecture allows you to perform inline inspection of traffic from multiple spoke VPCs in a simplified and scalable fashion while still centralizing your virtual appliances.

20] A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.
A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

 Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment

Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance

22] A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files.
Which storage option meets these requirements? 

B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.

S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.

25] A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.
During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.


"By dividing the functionality into two Lambda functions, one for receiving the information and the other for loading it into the database, you can independently scale and optimize each function based on their specific requirements. This approach allows for more efficient resource allocation and reduces the potential impact of high volumes of data on the overall system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

26] A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.

33] A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream. 

1. Real-time Data Stream: To share millions of financial transactions with other apps, you need to be able to ingest data in real-time, which is made possible by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.

2. Data Transformation: You can cleanse and eliminate sensitive data from transactions before storing them in Amazon DynamoDB by utilizing AWS Lambda with Kinesis Data Streams. This takes care of the requirement to handle sensitive data with care.
3. Scalability: DynamoDB and Amazon Kinesis are both extremely scalable technologies that can manage enormous data volumes and adjust to the workload.
To host a static website on Amazon S3, you would first need to create an S3 bucket. Then, you would need to upload the website files to the bucket. Once the files are uploaded, you can configure the bucket to serve as a website.

38] A company is hosting a static website on Amazon S3 and is using Amazon Route 53 for DNS. The website is experiencing increased demand from around the world. The company must decrease latency for users who access the website.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that distributes content globally to reduce latency. By setting up a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket hosting the static website, you can take advantage of its edge locations around the world to deliver content from the nearest location to the users, reducing the latency they experience.

CloudFront automatically caches and replicates content to its edge locations, resulting in faster delivery and lower latency for users worldwide. This solution is highly effective in optimizing performance while keeping costs under control because CloudFront charges are based on actual data transfer and requests, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures that you only pay for what you use.

39] A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against this data every day through the company's website.
The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.
Which solution addresses this performance issue?

A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.

Using Amazon Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD storage is the best way to solve the performance issue of insert operations taking 10 seconds or longer on an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table with more than 10 million rows and 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage.

A high-performance storage solution with reliable throughput and minimal latency is PIOPS SSD storage. Workloads like insert operations, which demand high I/O performance, are ideally suited for it.
------------------------------------------------------------

40] A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis.
The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and deliver streaming data into storage systems or analytics tools, making it an ideal solution for ingesting and storing status alerts. In this solution, the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ingests the alerts and delivers them to an S3 bucket, which is a cost-effective storage solution. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is set up to transition the data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days to minimize storage costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

41] A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?	

B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

Amazon AppFlow is a fully-managed integration service that enables you to securely exchange data between software as a service (SaaS) applications, such as Salesforce, and AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift.
The use of Appflow helps to remove the ec2 as the middle layer which slows down the process of data transmission and introduce an additional variable.
Appflow is also a fully managed AWS service, thus reducing the operational overhead.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

42] A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges.
What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?

C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3.

S3 VPC endpoint provides a way for an S3 request to be routed through to the Amazon S3 service, without having to connect a subnet to an internet gateway. The S3 VPC endpoint is what's known as a gateway endpoint.
-------------------------------------------------------------

43] A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3. The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.
Which solution meets these requirements?

B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.

AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

44] A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket
B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket

The two most effective steps a solutions architect can take to protect an Amazon S3 bucket from accidental deletion are:

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.

Versioning keeps multiple versions of objects in the S3 bucket, even when they are overwritten or deleted. This allows you to recover objects that have been accidentally deleted.

MFA Delete requires you to enter a one-time password from a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device before you can delete an object in the S3 bucket. This helps to prevent accidental deletions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

45] A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:
• An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries
• An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic. This will decouple the ingestion workflow and provide a buffer to temporarily store the data in case of network connectivity issues.

E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. This will allow the Lambda function to process the data from the SQS queue at its own pace, decoupling the data ingestion from the data delivery and providing more flexibility and fault tolerance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

46] A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.
Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

Some quotas can be increased, while others cannot. To request an increase to a quota, use the Service Quotas console. To learn how to request an increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. If a quota isn't available on the Service Quotas console, use the service limit increase form on the AWS Support Center Console to request an increase to the quota.
----------------------------------------------------

47] A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.
What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?

D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

48] A company's website uses an Amazon EC2 instance store for its catalog of items. The company wants to make sure that the catalog is highly available and that the catalog is stored in a durable location.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

D. Move the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.

EFS is fully managed, durable, highly available, and shared file system. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

49] A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select. 


S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for virtually any workload, especially data lakes, data analytics, new applications, and user-generated content.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50] A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.

AWS Systems Manager Run Command allows the company to run commands or scripts on multiple EC2 instances. By using Run Command, the company can quickly and easily apply the patch to all 1,000 EC2 instances to remediate the security vulnerability.

Creating an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Lambda functions are not designed to run on EC2 instances. Configuring AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Patch Manager is not designed to apply third-party software patches. Scheduling an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as maintenance windows are not designed to apply patches to third-party software.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

216] A company has a serverless website with millions of objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company uses the S3 bucket as the origin for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. The company did not set encryption on the S3 bucket before the objects were loaded. A solutions architect needs to enable encryption for all existing objects and for all objects that are added to the S3 bucket in the future.


Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of effort?

B. Turn on the default encryption settings for the S3 bucket. Use the S3 Inventory feature to create a .csv file that lists the unencrypted objects. Run an S3 Batch Operations job that uses the copy command to encrypt those objects.

This option utilizes the S3 Inventory feature to generate a list of unencrypted objects in the S3 bucket. It then leverages S3 Batch Operations to perform a copy operation, allowing the encryption of the objects during the copy process. This approach is efficient and does not require downloading and re-uploading all existing objects.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

217] A company runs a global web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application stores data in Amazon Aurora. The company needs to create a disaster recovery solution and can tolerate up to 30 minutes of downtime and potential data loss. The solution does not need to handle the load when the primary infrastructure is healthy.

222] A company has hired an external vendor to perform work in the company’s AWS account. The vendor uses an automated tool that is hosted in an AWS account that the vendor owns. The vendor does not have IAM access to the company’s AWS account.

How should a solutions architect grant this access to the vendor?

A. Create an IAM role in the company’s account to delegate access to the vendor’s IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for the permissions that the vendor requires.

IAM roles allow you to delegate access to resources in your AWS account to another AWS account. In this case, you can create a role in your account and grant the vendor's IAM role permission to assume that role.

By doing this, the vendor can use temporary security credentials obtained by assuming the role to access resources in your account. This ensures that the vendor doesn't need IAM credentials from your account.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

223] A company has deployed a Java Spring Boot application as a pod that runs on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) in private subnets. The application needs to write data to an Amazon DynamoDB table. A solutions architect must ensure that the application can interact with the DynamoDB table without exposing traffic to the internet.

Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to accomplish this goal? (Choose two.)

A. Attach an IAM role that has sufficient privileges to the EKS pod. Most Voted

D. Create a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB. Most Voted

This IAM role should have the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB. You can attach the IAM role to the pod using Kubernetes service account annotations or other mechanisms.

By creating a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB, you allow your EKS pods to access DynamoDB directly within the AWS network without traversing the public internet. This enhances security and reduces the risk of exposure.

227] A company needs to retain its AWS CloudTrail logs for 3 years. The company is enforcing CloudTrail across a set of AWS accounts by using AWS Organizations from the parent account. The CloudTrail target S3 bucket is configured with S3 Versioning enabled. An S3 Lifecycle policy is in place to delete current objects after 3 years.

After the fourth year of use of the S3 bucket, the S3 bucket metrics show that the number of objects has continued to rise. However, the number of new CloudTrail logs that are delivered to the S3 bucket has remained consistent.

Which solution will delete objects that are older than 3 years in the MOST cost-effective manner?

B. Configure the S3 Lifecycle policy to delete previous versions as well as current versions.

S3 Lifecycle Policy: Enabling S3 versioning allows you to use a lifecycle policy to manage both current and previous versions of objects in the bucket. By configuring the S3 Lifecycle policy to delete objects older than 3 years, it will automatically delete both the current and previous versions that meet the specified criteria.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

228] A company has an API that receives real-time data from a fleet of monitoring devices. The API stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the monitoring devices send to the API fluctuates. During periods of heavy traffic, the API often returns timeout errors.

After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of processing the volume of write traffic that comes from the API. A solutions architect must minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy traffic.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

C. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database.

Amazon SQS: SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that decouples the components of a cloud application. It acts as a buffer between the API and the database, allowing for better handling of varying write traffic.

AWS Lambda: Using Lambda to process the data from the SQS queue helps in efficiently managing the connection to the database. Lambda functions can be scaled automatically based on the incoming workload.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

229] A company manages its own Amazon EC2 instances that run MySQL databases. The company is manually managing replication and scaling as demand increases or decreases. The company needs a new solution that simplifies the process of adding or removing compute capacity to or from its database tier as needed. The solution also must offer improved performance, scaling, and durability with minimal effort from operations.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Migrate the databases to Amazon Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL.

Amazon Aurora Serverless: Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora. It automatically adjusts the database capacity based on actual consumption, enabling seamless scaling without manual intervention. It is a fully managed service, reducing operational overhead.

231] An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance that has an Elastic IP address in VPC A. The application requires access to a database in VPC B. Both VPCs are in the same AWS account.

Which solution will provide the required access MOST securely?

B. Configure a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B.

VPC peering allows direct connectivity between two VPCs. This solution enables communication between instances in VPC A and VPC B using private IP addresses. It does not require public IP addresses or the exposure of databases to the public internet.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

232] A company runs demonstration environments for its customers on Amazon EC2 instances. Each environment is isolated in its own VPC. The company’s operations team needs to be notified when RDP or SSH access to an environment has been established.

B. Configure the EC2 instances with an IAM instance profile that has an IAM role with the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy attached.

The correct option for notifying the operations team when RDP or SSH access to an environment has been established is:

C. Publish VPC flow logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Create required metric filters. Create an Amazon CloudWatch metric alarm with a notification action for when the alarm is in the ALARM state.

Here's why:

VPC Flow Logs:** VPC flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This includes information about accepted and rejected connections. To monitor RDP or SSH access, you can analyze these logs.

CloudWatch Logs:** By publishing VPC flow logs to CloudWatch Logs, you can analyze the logs using metric filters to extract relevant information.

Metric Filters:** Create metric filters to match the patterns corresponding to RDP or SSH access in the CloudWatch Logs. For example, you can create metric filters that look for specific keywords or patterns related to RDP or SSH connections.
CloudWatch Metric Alarm:** Set up CloudWatch metric alarms based on the metric filters. When the alarm is triggered (indicating that RDP or SSH access has been detected), it can take a notification action, such as sending a notification to the operations team via Amazon SNS.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

233] A solutions architect has created a new AWS account and must secure AWS account root user access.

Which combination of actions will accomplish this? (Choose two.)

A. Ensure the root user uses a strong password.
B. Enable multi-factor authentication to the root user.

Using a strong, complex password for the root user is a fundamental security practice. This helps protect the account from unauthorized access.
Enabling MFA adds an additional layer of security. Even if someone manages to obtain the root user's password, they would still need the second factor (e.g., a mobile device or hardware token) to successfully authenticate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

234] A company is building a new web-based customer relationship management application. The application will use several Amazon EC2 instances that are backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application will also use an Amazon Aurora database. All data for the application must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

C. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the EBS volumes and Aurora database storage at rest. Attach an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate to the ALB to encrypt data in transit.

Using AWS KMS to encrypt EBS volumes and Aurora database storage at rest is a good practice. You can specify a KMS key when creating these resources to ensure data encryption.

Attaching an ACM certificate to the ALB allows you to use HTTPS, which encrypts data in transit between clients and the ALB. This ensures secure communication over the network.

237] An application running on an Amazon EC2 instance in VPC-A needs to access files in another EC2 instance in VPC-B. Both VPCs are in separate AWS accounts. The network administrator needs to design a solution to configure secure access to EC2 instance in VPC-B from VPC-A. The connectivity should not have a single point of failure or bandwidth concerns.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Set up a VPC peering connection between VPC-A and VPC-B.

A VPC peering connection allows secure communication between instances in different VPCs using private IP addresses without the need for internet gateways, VPN connections, or NAT devices. By setting it up, the application running in VPC-A can directly access the EC2 in VPC-B without going through the public internet or any single point of failure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

238] A company wants to experiment with individual AWS accounts for its engineer team. The company wants to be notified as soon as the Amazon EC2 instance usage for a given month exceeds a specific threshold for each account.

What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement MOST cost-effectively?

C. Use AWS Budgets to create a cost budget for each account. Set the period to monthly. Set the scope to EC2 instances. Set an alert threshold for the budget. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive a notification when a threshold is exceeded.

AWS Budgets is a cost management service that allows you to set custom cost and usage budgets that alert you when you exceed your thresholds. In this case, you can create a monthly budget specifically for EC2 instances, and when the usage exceeds the defined threshold, it triggers an alert.
------------------------------------------------------------------

239] A solutions architect needs to design a new microservice for a company’s application. Clients must be able to call an HTTPS endpoint to reach the microservice. The microservice also must use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authenticate calls. The solutions architect will write the logic for this microservice by using a single AWS Lambda function that is written in Go 1.x.

Which solution will deploy the function in the MOST operationally efficient way?

A. Create an Amazon API Gateway REST API. Configure the method to use the Lambda function. Enable IAM authentication on the API.

This option is specifically designed for creating APIs and provides features such as authentication, request validation, and more. It allows you to create a REST API, configure a method to invoke the Lambda function, and enable IAM authentication. This provides a dedicated and managed API endpoint for clients to call securely.

243] A medical research lab produces data that is related to a new study. The lab wants to make the data available with minimum latency to clinics across the country for their on-premises, file-based applications. The data files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that has read-only permissions for each clinic.

What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on premises at each clinic

This option provides a way to present an S3 bucket as a file system to on-premises applications. Each clinic can deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway as a VM on-premises, allowing them to access the data in the S3 bucket as if it were local files. It minimizes latency because the data is cached locally, and read-only permissions can be controlled at the S3 bucket level.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

244] A company is using a content management system that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The EC2 instance contains both the web server and the database software. The company must make its website platform highly available and must enable the website to scale to meet user demand.

What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

C. Move the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another Availability Zone. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load Balancer in two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two Availability Zones.

This option provides both high availability and scalability. Using Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another Availability Zone ensures data redundancy and failover capabilities. Configuring an Application Load Balancer across two Availability Zones and using Auto Scaling allows for scalability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

245] A company is launching an application on AWS. The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to direct traffic to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group. The instances are in an Auto Scaling group for each environment. The company requires a development environment and a production environment. The production environment will have periods of high traffic.

Which solution will configure the development environment MOST cost-effectively?

A. Reconfigure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target.

For a development environment, where high availability and scalability might not be as critical as in production, having only one EC2 instance as a target in the target group could be a cost-effective solution. This reduces the number of running instances in the development environment when compared to production.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

246] A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances are in private subnets. A solutions architect implements an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) and specifies the EC2 instances as the target group. However, the internet traffic is not reaching the EC2 instances.

How should the solutions architect reconfigure the architecture to resolve this issue?

D. Create public subnets in each Availability Zone. Associate the public subnets with the ALB. Update the route tables for the public subnets with a route to the private subnets.

This option involves creating public subnets for the ALB, allowing it to receive internet traffic. The EC2 instances can remain in private subnets. This approach follows the best practice of using public subnets for internet-facing components like ALBs.

255] A company has an ecommerce checkout workflow that writes an order to a database and calls a service to process the payment. Users are experiencing timeouts during the checkout process. When users resubmit the checkout form, multiple unique orders are created for the same desired transaction.

How should a solutions architect refactor this workflow to prevent the creation of multiple orders?

D. Store the order in the database. Send a message that includes the order number to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Set the payment service to retrieve the message and process the order. Delete the message from the queue.
Storing the order in the database first ensures that the order information is saved, even if the payment processing is delayed or fails.
Sending a message to an SQS FIFO queue with the order number ensures that the processing is idempotent. If the same order number is sent multiple times, SQS guarantees that the messages are processed in order and only once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

256] A solutions architect is implementing a document review application using an Amazon S3 bucket for storage. The solution must prevent accidental deletion of the documents and ensure that all versions of the documents are available. Users must be able to download, modify, and upload documents.

Which combination of actions should be taken to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

B. Enable versioning on the bucket.

D. Enable MFA Delete on the bucket.
B. allows multiple versions of objects in the S3 bucket to be stored. This ensures that all versions of the documents are available, even if they are accidentally overwritten or deleted.

D. adds an extra layer of protection against accidental deletion of objects in the bucket. With MFA Delete enabled, a user would need to provide an additional authentication factor to successfully delete objects from the bucket. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions and provides an extra level of security for critical documents.

263] A company is building an application that consists of several microservices. The company has decided to use container technologies to deploy its software on AWS. The company needs a solution that minimizes the amount of ongoing effort for maintenance and scaling. The company cannot manage additional infrastructure.

Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Deploy an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster.

D. Deploy an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service with a Fargate launch type. Specify a desired task number level of greater than or equal to 2.

An ECS cluster is necessary to organize and manage your Fargate tasks and services. It provides a logical grouping of tasks and services.
When using Fargate, you don't need to manage the underlying EC2 instances; the cluster helps manage the Fargate tasks.

Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the need to manage underlying infrastructure.
With Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage EC2 instances; AWS takes care of the infrastructure, allowing you to focus solely on your containers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

264] A company has a web application hosted over 10 Amazon EC2 instances with traffic directed by Amazon Route 53. The company occasionally experiences a timeout error when attempting to browse the application. The networking team finds that some DNS queries return IP addresses of unhealthy instances, resulting in the timeout error.

What should a solutions architect implement to overcome these timeout errors?

D. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a health check in front of the EC2 instances. Route to the ALB from Route 53.

By creating an ALB and configuring health checks, the architect ensures that only healthy instances receive traffic. The ALB periodically checks the health of the EC2 instances based on the configured health check settings.

Routing traffic to the ALB from Route 53 ensures that DNS queries return the IP address of the ALB instead of individual instances. This allows the ALB to distribute traffic only to healthy instances, avoiding timeouts caused by unhealthy instances.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

265] A solutions architect needs to design a highly available application consisting of web, application, and database tiers. HTTPS content delivery should be as close to the edge as possible, with the least delivery time.

How should the scaling be changed to address the staff complaints and keep costs to a minimum?

C. Implement a target tracking action triggered at a lower CPU threshold, and decrease the cooldown period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

276] A company has a multi-tier application deployed on several Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. An Amazon RDS for Oracle instance is the application’ s data layer that uses Oracle-specific PL/SQL functions. Traffic to the application has been steadily increasing. This is causing the EC2 instances to become overloaded and the RDS instance to run out of storage. The Auto Scaling group does not have any scaling metrics and defines the minimum healthy instance count only. The company predicts that traffic will continue to increase at a steady but unpredictable rate before leveling off.

What should a solutions architect do to ensure the system can automatically scale for the increased traffic? (Choose two.)

A. Configure storage Auto Scaling on the RDS for Oracle instance.

This option allows the RDS instance to automatically scale its storage based on the actual storage usage, ensuring that you don't run out of storage.

D. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use the average CPU as the scaling metric.

By using CPU utilization as a scaling metric, the Auto Scaling group can dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the application's demand. This helps in handling increased traffic and preventing overload on existing instances.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

277] A company provides an online service for posting video content and transcoding it for use by any mobile platform.

This serverless architecture eliminates the need for managing and maintaining infrastructure, and costs are based on actual usage, making it cost-effective for low-traffic scenarios.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

286] A company has a static website that is hosted on Amazon CloudFront in front of Amazon S3. The static website uses a database backend. The company notices that the website does not reflect updates that have been made in the website’s Git repository. The company checks the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline between the Git repository and Amazon S3. The company verifies that the webhooks are configured properly and that the CI/CD pipeline is sending messages that indicate successful deployments.

A solutions architect needs to implement a solution that displays the updates on the website.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

C. Invalidate the CloudFront cache.

When the website does not reflect updates that have been made in the Git repository, and the CI/CD pipeline is sending messages indicating successful deployments, it's likely that the issue is related to caching. Amazon CloudFront caches content to improve performance and reduce latency, and if the cache is not updated, it may serve stale content.

By invalidating the CloudFront cache, you ensure that the next request to CloudFront fetches the latest content from the origin (in this case, Amazon S3). This process forces CloudFront to re-fetch the content and update its cache.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
287] A company wants to migrate a Windows-based application from on premises to the AWS Cloud. The application has three tiers: an application tier, a business tier, and a database tier with Microsoft SQL Server.

B. Apply an IAM role to the Lambda function. Apply an IAM policy to the role to grant read access to the S3 bucket.

An IAM role provides temporary credentials to the Lambda function to access AWS resources. The function does not have persistent credentials.
The IAM policy grants least privilege access by specifying read access only to the specific S3 bucket needed. Access is not granted to all S3 buckets.
If the Lambda function is compromised, the attacker would only gain access to the one specified S3 bucket. They would not receive broad access to resources.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

290] A company hosts a web application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group that scales in response to user demand. The company wants to optimize cost savings without making a long-term commitment.

Which EC2 instance purchasing option should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

C. A mix of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances

On-Demand Instances: These instances are charged per hour or per second of usage, without any upfront payment or long-term commitment. While they offer flexibility, they are usually more expensive compared to other purchasing options.

Spot Instances: These are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at a lower price compared to On-Demand Instances.

342] A transaction processing company has weekly scripted batch jobs that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The number of transactions can vary, but the baseline CPU utilization that is noted on each run is at least 60%. The company needs to provision the capacity 30 minutes before the jobs run.

Currently, engineers complete this task by manually modifying the Auto Scaling group parameters. The company does not have the resources to analyze the required capacity trends for the Auto Scaling group counts. The company needs an automated way to modify the Auto Scaling group’s desired capacity.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

C. Create a predictive scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group. Configure the policy to scale based on forecast. Set the scaling metric to CPU utilization. Set the target value for the metric to 60%. In the policy, set the instances to pre-launch 30 minutes before the jobs run.

In general, if you have regular patterns of traffic increases and applications that take a long time to initialize, you should consider using predictive scaling. Predictive scaling can help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load, compared to using only dynamic scaling, which is reactive in nature.

379] A company hosts a frontend application that uses an Amazon API Gateway API backend that is integrated with AWS Lambda. When the API receives requests, the Lambda function loads many libraries. Then the Lambda function connects to an Amazon RDS database, processes the data, and returns the data to the frontend application. The company wants to ensure that response latency is as low as possible for all its users with the fewest number of changes to the company's operations.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function that handles the requests.

Provisioned Concurrency: Provisioned concurrency allows you to pre-warm a specific number of instances of your Lambda function. This ensures that there are already instances available to handle incoming requests, reducing the cold start latency. Since the Lambda function loads many libraries, reducing cold start latency is crucial for optimizing response time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

380] A company is migrating its on-premises workload to the AWS Cloud. The company already uses several Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The company wants a solution that automatically starts and stops the EC2 instances and DB instances outside of business hours. The solution must minimize cost and infrastructure maintenance.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

D. Create an AWS Lambda function that will start and stop the EC2 instances and DB instances. Configure Amazon EventBridge to invoke the Lambda function on a schedule.

AWS Lambda Function: Create a Lambda function that contains the logic to start and stop the EC2 instances and DB instances. Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It is a cost-effective and maintenance-free solution.

Amazon EventBridge: Configure EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) to invoke the Lambda function on a schedule. EventBridge provides a reliable and scalable way to schedule the execution of Lambda functions at specified intervals, such as starting and stopping instances during business hours.

381] A company hosts a three-tier web application that includes a PostgreSQL database. The database stores the metadata from documents. The company searches the metadata for key terms to retrieve documents that the company reviews in a report each month. The documents are stored in Amazon S3. The documents are usually written only once, but they are updated frequently.

The reporting process takes a few hours with the use of relational queries. The reporting process must not prevent any document modifications or the addition of new documents. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to speed up the reporting process.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of change to the application code?

B. Set up a new Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that includes an Aurora Replica. Issue queries to the Aurora Replica to generate the reports.

 Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that includes an Aurora Replica. Issue queries to the Aurora Replica to generate the reports) is the best option for speeding up the reporting process for a three-tier web application that includes a PostgreSQL database storing metadata from documents, while not impacting document modifications or additions, with the least amount of change to the application code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

382] A company has a three-tier application on AWS that ingests sensor data from its users’ devices. The traffic flows through a Network Load Balancer (NLB), then to Amazon EC2 instances for the web tier, and finally to EC2 instances for the application tier. The application tier makes calls to a database.

What should a solutions architect do to improve the security of the data in transit?

A. Configure a TLS listener. Deploy the server certificate on the NLB.

TLS Listener on NLB: By configuring a TLS (Transport Layer Security) listener on the NLB, you can encrypt the traffic between the users' devices and the web tier EC2 instances. This helps protect the data in transit from eavesdropping and other potential security threats.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

383] A company is planning to migrate a commercial off-the-shelf application from its on-premises data center to AWS. The software has a software licensing model using sockets and cores with predictable capacity and uptime requirements. The company wants to use its existing licenses, which were purchased earlier this year.

Which Amazon EC2 pricing option is the MOST cost-effective?

A. Dedicated Reserved Hosts 

A Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. When you launch instances on a Dedicated Host, those instances run on the dedicated hardware of that host.
Dedicated Hosts provide control over the placement of instances for compliance, licensing, or regulatory requirements.
You can purchase Dedicated Hosts on a reservation model (Reserved Hosts) or pay for them on-demand. The host remains dedicated to you for the specified term in the case of Reserved Hosts.
Dedicated Hosts can be useful for workloads with specific licensing models tied to physical sockets or cores.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

384] A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 Linux instances across multiple Availability Zones. The application needs a storage layer that is highly available and Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)-compliant. The storage layer must provide maximum data durability and must be shareable across the EC2 instances. The data in the storage layer will be accessed frequently for the first 30 days and will be accessed infrequently after that time.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

C. Use the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Standard storage class. Create a lifecycle management policy to move infrequently accessed data to EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA).

Amazon EFS provides scalable and highly available file storage in the cloud. The Standard storage class is designed for frequently accessed data, making it suitable for the initial 30 days of frequent access.

You can create a lifecycle management policy for EFS that automatically transitions infrequently accessed files to the EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (EFS Standard-IA) storage class. This helps optimize costs by moving less frequently accessed data to a lower-cost storage tier.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

385] A solutions architect is creating a new VPC design. There are two public subnets for the load balancer, two private subnets for web servers, and two private subnets for MySQL. The web servers use only HTTPS. The solutions architect has already created a security group for the load balancer allowing port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. Company policy requires that each resource has the least access required to still be able to perform its tasks.

Which additional configuration strategy should the solutions architect use to meet these requirements?

C. Create a security group for the web servers and allow port 443 from the load balancer. Create a security group for the MySQL servers and allow port 3306 from the web servers security group.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

386] An ecommerce company is running a multi-tier application on AWS. The front-end and backend tiers both run on Amazon EC2, and the database runs on Amazon RDS for MySQL. The backend tier communicates with the RDS instance. There are frequent calls to return identical datasets from the database that are causing performance slowdowns.

Which action should be taken to improve the performance of the backend?

B. Implement Amazon ElastiCache to cache the large datasets.
Amazon ElastiCache: Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory caching service. By implementing ElastiCache, you can cache frequently accessed data in-memory, reducing the need to make repeated calls to the database. This helps improve the performance of your application by serving data directly from the cache instead of querying the database every time.

Caching Large Datasets: In scenarios where identical datasets are frequently requested, caching the results in ElastiCache can significantly reduce the load on the database and improve response times for subsequent requests. It is particularly effective for read-heavy workloads where the data does not change frequently.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

387] A new employee has joined a company as a deployment engineer. The deployment engineer will be using AWS CloudFormation templates to create multiple AWS resources. A solutions architect wants the deployment engineer to perform job activities while following the principle of least privilege.

Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to accomplish this goal? (Choose two.)

D. Create a new IAM user for the deployment engineer and add the IAM user to a group that has an IAM policy that allows AWS CloudFormation actions only.

E. Create an IAM role for the deployment engineer to explicitly define the permissions specific to the AWS CloudFormation stack and launch stacks using that IAM role.

This ensures that the IAM user has the necessary permissions for AWS CloudFormation but not unnecessary permissions for other AWS services.

IAM roles are more suitable for temporary elevated permissions needed during AWS CloudFormation stack operations. The deployment engineer can assume the role when required, limiting their permissions to only what is needed for those specific actions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

388] A company is deploying a two-tier web application in a VPC. The web tier is using an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with public subnets that span multiple Availability Zones. The database tier consists of an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance in separate private subnets. The web tier requires access to the database to retrieve product information.

The web application is not working as intended. The web application reports that it cannot connect to the database. The database is confirmed to be up and running. All configurations for the network ACLs, security groups, and route tables are still in their default states.

What should a solutions architect recommend to fix the application?

D. Add an inbound rule to the security group of the database tier’s RDS instance to allow traffic from the web tiers security group.

Security Groups: Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. By default, they deny all inbound traffic. In this scenario, the default security group associated with the RDS instance is likely denying incoming traffic from the web tier.

Inbound Rule: To allow traffic from the web tier's EC2 instances to the database tier's RDS instance, you need to add an inbound rule to the security group associated with the RDS instance. This rule should permit traffic from the security group associated with the web tier's EC2 instances.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

389] A company has a large dataset for its online advertising business stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance in a single Availability Zone. The company wants business reporting queries to run without impacting the write operations to the production DB instance.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Deploy RDS read replicas to process the business reporting queries.

Amazon RDS provides the ability to create read replicas of a source DB instance. Read replicas can be used to offload read traffic from the primary (write) DB instance, allowing you to scale read operations horizontally. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to run reporting queries without affecting the write performance of the production DB instance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

390] A company hosts a three-tier ecommerce application on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). All ecommerce data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MariaDB Multi-AZ DB instance.

Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

391] A company needs a backup strategy for its three-tier stateless web application. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group with a dynamic scaling policy that is configured to respond to scaling events. The database tier runs on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The web application does not require temporary local storage on the EC2 instances. The company’s recovery point objective (RPO) is 2 hours.

The backup strategy must maximize scalability and optimize resource utilization for this environment.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

C. Retain the latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of the web and application tiers. Enable automated backups in Amazon RDS and use point-in-time recovery to meet the RPO.

Snapshots of EBS volumes would be necessary if you want to back up the entire EC2 instance, including any applications and temporary data stored on the EBS volumes attached to the instances. When you take a snapshot of an EBS volume, it backs up the entire contents of that volume. This ensures that you can restore the entire EC2 instance to a specific point in time more quickly. However, if there is no temporary data stored on the EBS volumes, then snapshots of EBS volumes are not necessary.
---------------------------------------------------------------

392] A company wants to deploy a new public web application on AWS. The application includes a web server tier that uses Amazon EC2 instances. The application also includes a database tier that uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance.

The application must be secure and accessible for global customers that have dynamic IP addresses.

How should a solutions architect configure the security groups to meet these requirements?

A. Configure the security group for the web servers to allow inbound traffic on port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. Configure the security group for the DB instance to allow inbound traffic on port 3306 from the security group of the web servers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
393] A payment processing company records all voice communication with its customers and stores the audio files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company needs to capture the text from the audio files. The company must remove from the text any personally identifiable information (PII) that belongs to customers.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

C. Configure an Amazon Transcribe transcription job with PII redaction turned on. When an audio file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, invoke an AWS Lambda function to start the transcription job. Store the output in a separate S3 bucket.


Amazon Transcribe is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables automatic speech recognition (ASR). It allows developers to convert spoken language into written text, making it useful for various applications such as transcription services, voice analytics, and content indexing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
394] A company is running a multi-tier ecommerce web application in the AWS Cloud. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances with an Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. Amazon RDS is configured with the latest generation DB instance with 2,000 GB of storage in a General Purpose SSD (gp3) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. The database performance affects the application during periods of high demand.

A database administrator analyzes the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs and discovers that the application performance always degrades when the number of read and write IOPS is higher than 20,000.

What should a solutions architect do to improve the application performance?

C. Replace the volume with a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volume.

io2 volumes are designed for high-performance, low-latency applications such as databases.
Provisioned IOPS allows you to specify the amount of IOPS the volume needs, ensuring consistent performance.
For applications with high demand and where consistent performance is crucial, io2 volumes provide better control over IOPS compared to gp3 volumes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

395] An IAM user made several configuration changes to AWS resources in their company's account during a production deployment last week. A solutions architect learned that a couple of security group rules are not configured as desired. The solutions architect wants to confirm which IAM user was responsible for making changes.

Which service should the solutions architect use to find the desired information?

C. AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to monitor and log AWS account activity. It records API calls made on your AWS account, capturing information such as the identity of the caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service.

397] An ecommerce company needs to run a scheduled daily job to aggregate and filter sales records for analytics. The company stores the sales records in an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can be up to 10 GB in size. Based on the number of sales events, the job can take up to an hour to complete. The CPU and memory usage of the job are constant and are known in advance.

A solutions architect needs to minimize the amount of operational effort that is needed for the job to run.

Which solution meets these requirements?

C. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with an AWS Fargate launch type. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled event that launches an ECS task on the cluster to run the job.

C. Amazon ECS with Fargate: Fargate allows you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure. You can schedule the ECS task with EventBridge, and since Fargate manages the resources, you don't need to worry about scaling or infrastructure maintenance. This is a good fit for long-running jobs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

398] A company needs to transfer 600 TB of data from its on-premises network-attached storage (NAS) system to the AWS Cloud. The data transfer must be complete within 2 weeks. The data is sensitive and must be encrypted in transit. The company’s internet connection can support an upload speed of 100 Mbps.

Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

C. Use the AWS Snow Family console to order several AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Use the devices to transfer the data to Amazon S3.

Transferring 600 TB of data over a 100 Mbps connection would take a very long time. AWS Snowball Edge devices allow for offline data transfer, and you can transfer the data to the devices at your location before shipping them to AWS. This way, you are not constrained by the upload speed during the 2-week period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

399] A financial company hosts a web application on AWS. The application uses an Amazon API Gateway Regional API endpoint to give users the ability to retrieve current stock prices. The company’s security team has noticed an increase in the number of API requests. The security team is concerned that HTTP flood attacks might take the application offline.

A solutions architect must design a solution to protect the application from this type of attack.

Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

B. Create a Regional AWS WAF web ACL with a rate-based rule. Associate the web ACL with the API Gateway stage.

Rate-based Rule with AWS WAF: AWS WAF provides protection against various web application attacks, including HTTP flood attacks. By using a rate-based rule, you can set thresholds for the number of requests from a client IP within a specified time period. This helps in detecting and mitigating HTTP flood attacks effectively.

400] A meteorological startup company has a custom web application to sell weather data to its users online. The company uses Amazon DynamoDB to store its data and wants to build a new service that sends an alert to the managers of four internal teams every time a new weather event is recorded. The company does not want this new service to affect the performance of the current application.

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

C. Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams on the table. Use triggers to write to a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which the teams can subscribe.

Using a single SNS topic simplifies the notification process. The trigger can publish a message to this topic, and each internal team can subscribe to this topic. This reduces the operational overhead compared to managing multiple SNS topics (Option B).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


401] A company wants to use the AWS Cloud to make an existing application highly available and resilient. The current version of the application resides in the company's data center. The application recently experienced data loss after a database server crashed because of an unexpected power outage.

The company needs a solution that avoids any single points of failure. The solution must give the application the ability to scale to meet user demand.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy the application servers by using Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Use an Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ configuration.

Auto Scaling Across Multiple Availability Zones: Deploying application servers using EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) helps avoid a single point of failure. If one AZ experiences an issue, the application can continue to operate in another AZ.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

402] A company needs to ingest and handle large amounts of streaming data that its application generates. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and sends data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, which is configured with default settings. Every other day, the application consumes the data and writes the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for business intelligence (BI) processing. The company observes that Amazon S3 is not receiving all the data that the application sends to Kinesis Data Streams.

What should a solutions architect do to resolve this issue?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

403] A developer has an application that uses an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3 and needs the required permissions to perform the task. The developer already has an IAM user with valid IAM credentials required for Amazon S3.

What should a solutions architect do to grant the permissions?

D. Create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach the IAM role to the Lambda function.

o grant the necessary permissions to an AWS Lambda function to upload files to Amazon S3, a solutions architect should create an IAM execution role with the required permissions and attach the IAM role to the Lambda function. This approach follows the principle of least privilege and ensures that the Lambda function can only access the resources it needs to perform its specific task.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

404] A company has deployed a serverless application that invokes an AWS Lambda function when new documents are uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. The application uses the Lambda function to process the documents. After a recent marketing campaign, the company noticed that the application did not process many of the documents.

What should a solutions architect do to improve the architecture of this application?

D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Send the requests to the queue. Configure the queue as an event source for Lambda.

Introducing Amazon SQS as a queue allows for better decoupling between the S3 events and the document processing. This ensures that the Lambda function is not overwhelmed with spikes in incoming events, leading to missed document processing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

405] A solutions architect is designing the architecture for a software demonstration environment. The environment will run on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The system will experience significant increases in traffic during working hours but is not required to operate on weekends.

Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to ensure that the system can scale to meet demand? (Choose two.)

A. Use AWS Auto Scaling to adjust the ALB capacity based on request rate.

E. Use scheduled scaling to change the Auto Scaling group minimum, maximum, and desired capacity to zero for weekends. Revert to the default values at the start of the week.

This allows the ALB to automatically scale its capacity based on the incoming request rate, ensuring that the system can handle varying traffic loads.

This allows you to save costs and resources during weekends when the system is not required to operate. Scaling down the Auto Scaling group to zero instances during weekends and reverting to the default values at the start of the week ensures that you only incur costs when the system is actively in use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

406] A solutions architect is designing a two-tiered architecture that includes a public subnet and a database subnet. The web servers in the public subnet must be open to the internet on port 443.

Which solution will meet these requirements?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

418] A solutions architect needs to allow team members to access Amazon S3 buckets in two different AWS accounts: a development account and a production account. The team currently has access to S3 buckets in the development account by using unique IAM users that are assigned to an IAM group that has appropriate permissions in the account.

The solutions architect has created an IAM role in the production account. The role has a policy that grants access to an S3 bucket in the production account.

Which solution will meet these requirements while complying with the principle of least privilege?

B. Add the development account as a principal in the trust policy of the role in the production account.

By adding the development account as a principal in the trust policy of the IAM role in the production account, you enable IAM users in the development account to assume the role and gain temporary permissions to access the S3 bucket in the production account.

This approach follows the principle of least privilege because it allows users in the development account to access only the specific resources (S3 bucket) defined in the trust policy of the IAM role.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

419] A company uses AWS Organizations with all features enabled and runs multiple Amazon EC2 workloads in the ap-southeast-2 Region. The company has a service control policy (SCP) that prevents any resources from being created in any other Region. A security policy requires the company to encrypt all data at rest.

An audit discovers that employees have created Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for EC2 instances without encrypting the volumes.

651] A company stores a large volume of image files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The images need to be readily available for the first 180 days. The images are infrequently accessed for the next 180 days. After 360 days, the images need to be archived but must be available instantly upon request. After 5 years, only auditors can access the images. The auditors must be able to retrieve the images within 12 hours. The images cannot be lost during this process.

C) Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.
Explanation:
S3 Standard-IA (instead of One Zone-IA) ensures high durability across multiple AZs for infrequent access.
Glacier Instant Retrieval meets the "instant availability" requirement after 360 days, while Glacier Deep Archive is cost-effective for audits after 5 years.
(Option A/B use less durable One Zone-IA, and Option D uses slower Glacier Flexible Retrieval, which violates the "instant" requirement.)

Answer: C) Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.
gp3 allows independent provisioning of IOPS (unlike gp2) and is more cost-effective than io1 for 15,000 IOPS.
Magnetic volumes (Option D) are outdated and cannot meet the performance requirement.
